# "Israel" Website Template
July of 2016.

# My memories
My third project and freelance again. After I coped with email letter, I derived a desperate motivation to keep going. Consequently, I took the decision to find a new offer and work on it. Basically, the idea that I can accumulate some money while doing what I enjoy seemed to me to be perfect and unbelievable. (and it still is) So, after some time of searching, I've finally found a client interested in me. This time, I had to build a simple template which had two uncommon requirements:

1) it's content should be on Hebrew
2) *it should be responsive* (something new for me that time)

So, without further ado, I've got to work. This time, everything went smooth, I've successfully figured out what responsivity is and applied my new knowledge.

As a result, I got my money, new knowledge, experience. It was cool.

# Skills applied
-) Still basic HTML
-) More advanced CSS than before
-) @media queries to provide responsivity
-) My ability to absorb new knowledge like a sponge(really helps me throughout my life).
